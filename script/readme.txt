Below is a concise overview of your AWS Glue ETL code (glue_etl_job.py) and the utility file (etl_utils.py), explaining their purpose, how to follow the code, the logic implemented, and why prechecks are applied. This is tailored to your context, focusing on clarity and brevity while addressing your validated output file issue and aligning with big company practices.

Overview of glue_etl_job.py
Purpose:

Orchestrates an AWS Glue ETL job to validate and process CSV files stored in S3, producing a validated output CSV (optionally GZIP-compressed) with an exception column for validation errors.
Ensures data quality for downstream processing by performing file-level and data-level validations.


Logic Implemented:

File-Level Validations:
Checks if the file exists, matches the expected name pattern (e.g., vendor1_data_\d{8}\.csv), has non-zero size, 
correct headers, and compression (e.g., GZIP or none).

Data-Level Validations:
Validates date formats using to_date for strict matching (e.g., yyyy-MM-dd).
Checks for duplicate rows and primary keys.

Ensures mandatory fields (e.g., id, name) are not null.
Output:
Adds an exception column to the output CSV, listing validation errors (e.g., "date: Invalid date format. Expected yyyy-MM-dd").
Writes to s3://output/validated/ (e.g., part-00000.csv.gz).


Key Functions:
Config Loading: load_config reads the JSON configuration from S3 (e.g., s3://config/validation_config.json).
File Validations: check_file_exists, check_file_name, check_file_size, check_file_format_and_headers, check_compression, find_vendor_config.
Data Validation: validate_data performs row-level checks (dates, duplicates, mandatory fields).
Error Logging: log_errors writes validation errors to S3.
